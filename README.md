# Poke Collector
<!-- Javascript jQuery game -->


# Pseudo Code:
<!-- There are four pokemon displayed as buttons on the page. -->

<!-- The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game. -->

<!-- When the player clicks on a pokemon, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.  -->

<!-- The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a poke. -->

<!-- When they click one, the player score updates. -->

<!-- The poke is caught if their total score matches the random number provided at the beginning. -->

<!-- The poke flees if their score goes above the random number. -->

<!-- The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses. -->

<!-- When the game begins again, the player will see a new random number, and all the pokes will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero. -->

<!-- The score tracks the number of player catches and flees. -->
